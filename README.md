*Final link to dashboard and presentation coming soon*

An analysis of the state of protective forests in Switzerland, main factors of growth and health<br>

Datasets:
- Climate and Protective Forests' evolution since 1982, provided by the Swiss <a href="https://www.lfi.ch/">National Forest Inventory</a>
- Meteorological data in Switzerland (Daymet 1/1km)
- Satellite (Landsat5 & 7) imagery.

Forests in Switzerland are still increasing (in opposition to the global trend), but much less so in recent years. Moreover, area increase is not the only key factor to forests' health.

Deliverables :
- Presentation of the data, workflow and results
- Maps featuring rate of growth (or withering) and protective effect of forests, in relation to climate
- Dashboard with plots and results

Average temperature has very significantly increased over the past 40 years in Swiss protective forests, even more than in Switzerland at large which already sees its average temperatures <a href="https://www.iea.org/articles/switzerland-climate-resilience-policy-indicator">rise at a faster pace than the rest of the World</a>.

#### Navigate through the folders and files 
**Folders**<br>
*NFI_data*:
- Source data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory. Variable names & description in German
- Concatenation & initial EDA notebooks
- Modified files from concatenation and translation of variables and description in French

*meteo_data*:
- Excel file containing precipitations (in cm/square km) and temperature averages (in °C) for each forest plot
- Example plots and maps for each collection campaign<br>
Does NOT contain actual full meteorological files in netcdf (30 GB)

*docs*:<br>
- Useful documentation on Silva Protect Swiss framework and conversion from Swiss to WGS84 coordinates

*Docker*:
- Dockerfile to easily run Earth Engine (SAT notebooks in this repository) on Windows<br>
Add a requirements.txt with the following values (1 line each): earthengine-api numpy matplotlib pandas plotly requests datetime openpyxl

**Files**<br>
*meteo_1, meteo_2, meteo_3.ipynb*:
1. Understanding netcdf, what is in the files and how to access it
2. Defining functions to extract data and plotting maps for given time and intervals
3. Trends in temperature and precipitations through the years

*to_import_func_meteo.py*:
- To import predefined meteorological functions (provided you have the netcdf files) 

*eda.ipynb*:
- Understanding data from NFI collection campaigns, preparing the presentation and graphs

*modeling.ipynb*:
- Modeling to describe the current state of protective forests and determine useful features and targets
- Attempt to predict the future state of protective forests

*SAT_img_to_array_LANDSAT-5, SAT_aggreg.ipynb*:
- Collect satellite imagery for NFI campaigns (results in 8 to 10 GB files for each)
- Aggregate results into a csv file with NDVI,EVI,NDMI,NDWI,DSWI formulas
